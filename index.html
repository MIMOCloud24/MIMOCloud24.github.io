                    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Mimoune Tahri</strong>, a tech entrepreneur and cybersecurity student based in Orlando, Florida. I have a diverse background in networking, IT support, and cybersecurity, having worked in various roles from help desk technician to IT security specialist.</p>

                    <p>I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity Technology at UMGC and have already completed certifications like CompTIA A+ and Google IT Support. My journey doesn’t stop there—I’m aiming for more certifications like Network+,security+, Cloud+, AWS certifications, and CCNA, with a long-term goal of becoming a Cloud Security Architect.</p>

                    <p>Born in Morocco and now living in the U.S., I bring a multicultural perspective to my work. My career in IT started from humble beginnings, growing a home-based computer repair business, Techfix Solutions, into a successful venture. I’m passionate about helping others and sharing my knowledge through hands-on projects, which I’ll be documenting on this site.</p>

                    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy lifelong learning, working on personal projects, and spending time with my family. I believe in the power of technology to create meaningful solutions and make a positive impact.</p>
