            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                With a robust background in IT and a deep commitment to cybersecurity, I am focused on advancing my career toward becoming a Cloud Security Architect. 
                My journey began with hands-on roles across various IT disciplines, from network administration to launching Techfix Solutions, my own computer and cell phone repair business. 
                My experiences provide a strong foundation in managing and securing technology infrastructures, while my education in Cybersecurity Technology from UMGC expands my expertise in threat analysis, 
                risk management, and cloud security.
